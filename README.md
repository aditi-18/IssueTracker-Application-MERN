# My attempt on learning MERN by working on the book project, based on Pro MERN Stack 2nd Edition !!

This is my repository for the project described in the book Pro MERN Stack (2nd Ed) by Vasan Subramanian. This readme contains my jouney of learning MERN. I will describe my learnings through every chapter. I will also list down the difficultilies I have faced in very chapter. Finally, I will also put down the results I achieve.

## Chapter2

Through this chapter I learnt how to setup a project in my local system. I was able to install the necessary packages by reading through the textbook. I learnt .In this Hello World application, I was able to use React to create a simple page and use Node.js and Express to 
serve that page from a web server. This helped me learn fundamentals of these technologies.I also learned how to work with  nvm, npm,JSX and babel. I also worked in pushing the code to  my github repository.
